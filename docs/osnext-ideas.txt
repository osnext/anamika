Walkthrough:
============
fire up the box
os shows schematic of the system
as parts are identified, verified and made ready, the schematic shows the progress
  there's ability to hide/show this feature. hide is the default
at login, the usual uid/pwd screen is conspicuous by its absence. instead the desktop shows up directly.
the desktop is a "naked" interface, ie, without much chrome. 
there is, however, a hidden HUD with:
	- a run control similar to the Windows Start button or spotlight on mac.
	- a workspaces control that zooms out to show all workspaces
	- the current user in force. by default this is "everyone". the switch to a specific user is only when the user demands it.
	- the schematic from the startup which now doubles as the "control panel"
Long press on Win/Cmd key => HUD shown with icons at the 4 corners of the screen.
No menus, object expose context menus which are radial
	- inheritance depicted via colors on menu items
Main display has top categories by usage
choosing any object prompts for verb, ie app to open it with
direct acces to versions of objects from context menu
all content is shared by everybody using the system, until specifically opted to become "private"
two/more users can be logged in at the same time. 
the default worspace is "share all", but can move to private workspace when required

each desktop has multiple workspaces with an integrated todo list
objects (eg, todos) can be moved from one workspace to another without context switch.

Shoulds:
========
- Should support all the following interaction modes:
  - subject, verb, object: eg "Excel, open, abc.xls".
  - object, verb, subject: eg, "abc.xls, open with, Excel" or "abc.xls, send to, trash"
  - verb, subject, object: eg, "open, excel, abc.xls". this is useful for launchers where the action is thought of first.
  - verb, object, subject: eg, "open, abc.xls, excel".
